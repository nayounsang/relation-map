## Undirected Graph

- a type of graph where each Edge (connection) between Vertices does not have a direction. 
- if there is an edge between two vertices `A` and `B`, it implies a bidirectional connection; information or traversal can move from `A` to `B` and vice versa without restriction. 
- This type of graph is often used to represent symmetric relationships or two-way connections, such as social networks or undirected maps.

### Term Explanation

- Vertex: A point or node in a graph that represents an entity, such as a person in a network or a location on a map.
- Edge: A connection between two vertices, forming a relationship or link. In an undirected graph, it represents a two-way connection.
